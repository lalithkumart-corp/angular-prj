            <h2>Summary: Reg SERVICE state(data-model), and its Singleton behaviour across components</h2>
            <p>Date: 25/12/2017</p>
            <p><b> <i>ISSUE:</i> </b>
                I had 1 service , and 2 components.
                The service had one variable. This service had been included in provider array in both components
                <b>When one component calls the service method block & fetch data from API and updates the datamodel in the service, then this updated dataModel in service is not been seen/available for the other component</b>
                But, i need to read/get the updated dataModel from service in my other component.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b> <i>SOLUTION: </i></b>
                When we include a service in 'providers', then it is instantiated and this state is maintained between its component as well as its child components.

                And, if we include the service in both components provider array, then it is no more following singleton. The state will be independent and not shared between them.

                So, include your service only at parent component or your root component.(or module)

                I too faced this issue and solved with help of this solution here, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/38034298/5730167">https://stackoverflow.com/a/38034298/5730167</a>.

                So, be carefull in including the service in module, component... based on your need.
